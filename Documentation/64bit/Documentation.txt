			AsmFun module

AsmFun is the assembler functions for more convinient coding in nasm

Here's the list of all functions and their purpose for your coding pleasure:

1. _add0

	Purpose:
		This function adds 0 code in ASCII [NULL] to the string pointer.
		You will need to do this for _print cause it counts the
		string to that character.	

	Input: 
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- String in rdi pointer is modified

		- al is modified

	Dependency: 
		If you want to use this function you have to put this line 
		of code into the end of your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Add0/main.asm"

2. _addMinus

	Purpose:
		This function adds "-" character (45 in ASCII) to the string pointer.

	Input:
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- string being pointed by is modified
		
		- rdi is incremented
		
		- bl equals to 45

	Dependency:
		Put this line of code into your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/AddMinus/main.asm"

3. _addNewLineCharacter

	Purpose:
		This function add "\n" character (10 in ASCII) to the string pointer.

	Input:
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- string being pointed by rdi is modified
		
		- bl equals to 10

4. _assignFlippedIntegerPortion

	Purpose:
